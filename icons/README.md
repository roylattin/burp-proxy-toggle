# Icon Placeholder Files

The icons in this directory are placeholder files for the Burp Proxy Toggle extension.

## Required Icons
- icon16.png - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- icon32.png - 32x32 pixels (extension management)
- icon48.png - 48x48 pixels (extension management)
- icon128.png - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Your Own Icons

To create proper icons for this extension:

1. Design an icon that represents the Burp Suite proxy functionality
2. Create versions in the required sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128)
3. Save them as PNG files with the exact names above
4. Replace the placeholder files in this directory

## Recommended Design
- Use Burp Suite's orange/red color scheme (#ff6b35)
- Include elements that suggest proxy/networking (arrows, connection symbols)
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility in both light and dark themes

## Temporary Solution
For testing purposes, you can use any PNG images with the correct dimensions and filenames. The extension will work without proper icons, but they improve the user experience.
